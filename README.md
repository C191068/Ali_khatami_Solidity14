Figure1: execution cost of this ```akrkFundMe.sol``` contract created at previos repository is about ```693155 gas```

To decrease this cost we gonna learn two keywords one is ```constant``` keyword nad another is ```immutable``` keyword <br>

if you assing a variable outside of a function and never change it then use ```constant``` keyword
